        <p class="box_text">
            If you have a passport or foreign registration card, you can easily exchange foreign money or traveler’s checks for Korean won at local banks. Be sure to keep the slip that the bank issues as evidence of a foreign exchange transaction. The slip will help you sell your Korean won for a foreign currency more easily on your departure from Korea.
