            <p>
                There is a saying that in a new time, we must have a new heart. <br />
                In this new time, if there is excitement that makes our hearts beat with anticipation, then in our new hearts, there will be a steadfast commitment that strengthens us. <br /><br />

                As the District Mayor of Seongbuk-gu, in this hopeful new year, I, too, renew my commitment to take responsibility for the lives of our 430,000 Seongbuk-gu residents. <br /><br />

                In 2024, I am committed to upholding the fundamentals and principles across all aspects of district administration. With more open communication and improved policies, I will strive to make Seongbuk-gu a better place to live. <br /><br />

                As we embark on the new year, in the warm-hearted community of Seongbuk-gu, I hope that, through renewed resolve and new challenges, all Seongbuk-gu residents will achieve their dreams. <br /><br />

                Respected residents! <br />
                In the coming year, I will continue to walk alongside you in the heart of your lives, in village entrances and neighborhood alleys. <br /><br />

                May this new year bring more love to give and receive.
            </p>
