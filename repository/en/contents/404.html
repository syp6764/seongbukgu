                <p>
                    Seongbuk-gu is a key area linking central Seoul with the northeastern regions, with the name “Seongbuk” originating from its literal meaning of its location in the city ("seong") to the north ("buk"). <br />
                    To the northwest lies Bukhansan Mountain, while the Jeongneungcheon and Seongbukcheon Streams flow from east to west. Amidst its scenic natural surroundings, Seongbuk-gu is rich in history and culture, home to landmarks like the Hanyangdoseong (Seoul City Wall), Jeongneung Royal Tomb, and the Kansong Art Museum. <br />

            Additionally, Seongbuk-gu is an intellectual and cultured education hub, with prestigious institutions, including eight universities, and is also a unique area with a global touch, hosting forty foreign embassies’ residences. <br />
            Focusing on people-centered investments to ensure a happy life for all residents, (including seniors, children, and those with disabilities) Seongbuk-gu is transforming into one of Seoul’s most livable districts.
