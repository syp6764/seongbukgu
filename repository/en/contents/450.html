                The Seonjam Complex (Historic Site No. 83) located in central Seongbuk-dong was once the site of the Seonjam Ritual, a state ceremony conducted to pray for a prosperous sericulture under the patronage of Lady Seoreung, the deity of silk farming. Though the tradition was interrupted by Japanese rule in 1908, it was revived in May 1993 by Seongbuk-dong residents. Since then, the Seonjam Ritual Preservation Committee, led by local residents, has continued the ceremony annually. <br /><br />

                On the day of the ritual, additional events like the Seonjam Queen and Princess Parade, along with sericulture experiences, make it a vibrant traditional festival representing Seongbuk-gu. The original structure of the Seonjam Complex was confirmed through excavations in 2016, and it is currently undergoing restoration as of 2019. Although the ceremony is on hold, it will resume upon completion of the restoration.
