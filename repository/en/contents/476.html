            ﻿Originally designated as Seoul Monument No. 7 on July 5, 1985, this site was elevated to Historic Site No. 550 on April 8, 2019. This house is where "Manhae" Han Yong-un (1879–1944), a notable independence activist and one of the 33 national representatives of the March 1st Movement, as well as the poet of Silence of Love (Nim-ui Chimmuk), lived from 1933 until his passing in 1944. Entering through the eastern gate, you will find Simujang, a small tiled-roof house facing north, along with a management office and a juniper tree planted by Han himself. <br /><br />

            Simujang is a modest five-room house. The layout includes an anbang (heated room) on the left and a kitchen on the right, with a daecheong (main hall) in the center. Behind the kitchen, there is a pantry area known as chan maru. <br /><br />

            The anbang, which served as Han Yong-un’s study, features a plaque with the name Simujang (尋牛莊), derived from a Buddhist parable that likens the search for enlightenment to searching for a lost ox. The Seongbuk-dong area, where Simujang is located, was developed as a residential neighborhood in the 1930s during the expansion of Seoul. This house stands out from others of that era with its simple and unadorned appearance. <br /><br />
