                Seongbuk-gu hosts its Local Town Festival to promote its unique regional features, traditional history, and joint programs led by public, private, academic institutions.<br/>
                The Festival is held in October every year with a schedule designed to highlight the characteristics of each dong district across Seongbuk-gu.<br/>
                Particularly worth noting is the Samseon Fairy Festival, the Jeongneung Willow Festival, the Jangwi Buma Festival, and the Seokgwan Uireung Festival.<br/>
                These Festivals are held at some of our countryâ€™s best-known historical sites, including the Joseon Royal Tombs at Jeongneung and Uireung, as well as the Seoul City Wall. Visitors can enjoy a variety of cultural performances, food, and flea markets, and they can also take part in cultural activities such as the Fairy Parade, Royal Procession, and Buma Traditional Wedding Ceremony programs.
