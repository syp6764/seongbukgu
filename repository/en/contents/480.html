            Gilsangsa Temple was established on the site of Daewongak, which was one of the most prestigious traditional Korean-style houses, along with Samcheonggak and Cheongungak, until the late 1980s. The late Kim Yeong-han donated over 23,000 m² of land and more than 40 buildings to Venerable Beopjeong, transforming it into Gilsangsa Temple in 1997. The temple is renowned for being surrounded by trees, forests, and fresh air, providing a serene atmosphere despite being located in the city. <br /><br />

            Known for its natural blend of trees, forest, and fresh air, it provides tranquility in the city. Aged 265 and 165 years, the two protected zelkova trees from the government of Seoul, offers a shade in summer and create a space for meditation in spring and fall. The temple serves as a cultural space, offering programs like temple stays, retreats, art contests, and concerts, and supports Beopjeong's Clean and Fragrant movement for a healthy society.
