                In 2008, a multicultural food festival was launched in Seongbuk-dong, home to around forty embassy residences, in honor of UN-designated World Day for Cultural Diversity. Since 2015, the term “multicultural” has been replaced with “intercultural,” and the festival was rebranded as Seongbuk World Food Festival Nurimasil, marking its 11th year in 2019. Centered around global cuisine, this cultural diversity festival offers performances, interactive experiences, markets, and more, promoting understanding and respect across diverse cultures, ethnicities, nations, and generations. With collaboration between local government, residents, and artists, it has become a flagship event that embodies the community spirit of Seongbuk-gu.
