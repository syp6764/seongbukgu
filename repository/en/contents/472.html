            Designated as Historic Site No. 208, this tomb is for Queen Sindeok (?-1396) of the Kang clan, King Taejo’s second queen. Originally located in Jeongdong, it was relocated to its current site outside the city walls in the 9th year of King Taejong's reign (1409), following the decision by the state council that royal tombs should be outside the capital. <br /><br />

            After the move, Taejong ordered the removal of the shrine building and repurposed stones from the tomb to rebuild the Gwangtonggyo Bridge, which had been washed away by a flood. For centuries, Jeongneung stood neglected until it was restored in the 10th year of King Hyeonjong’s reign (1669) following a petition by Song Si-yeol. <br /><br />

            Unlike other royal tombs, Jeongneung has no surrounding stone screen or balustrade, and features only one pair of protective stones and sheep stones, with no statues of civil or military officials, making it relatively simple in comparison. The square lantern and other stonework at Jeongneung follow the style of Goryeo royal tombs, particularly those of King Gongmin and Queen Noguk at Hyeolleung, indicating that early Joseon royal tombs were influenced by Goryeo traditions.
